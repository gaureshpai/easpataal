# EASPATAAL - Hospital Queue Management System

*HealthCare is all about Safety, User Experience and Simplicity*

A full-stack web/mobile application designed to eliminate long waiting times and enhance efficiency in hospital environments, specifically addressing the challenges of overcrowded queues common in many Indian hospitals.

## The Problem

In many Indian government and private hospitals, patients spend hours waiting in long queues for registration, doctor consultation, or lab tests. With no proper system to track their turn, patients face frustration, overcrowding, and wasted time. Hospitals also struggle to manage multiple counters and departments efficiently, leading to delays and patient dissatisfaction.

## The Solution

EASPATAAL is a real-time queue management system designed to tackle these challenges. It consists of two main components:

*   **Hospital Queue Management System:** A comprehensive dashboard for hospital staff (admins, doctors, receptionists, pharmacists) to manage patient flow, appointments, and services.
*   **Patient Portal:** A patient-facing application to track their queue status in real-time, reducing uncertainty and waiting times.

## Key Features

*   **Real-Time Queue Tracking:** Patients can monitor their position in the queue from their mobile devices.
*   **User-Specific Dashboards:** Tailored interfaces for different user roles (Admin, Doctor, Pharmacist, Receptionist).
*   **Patient Management:** Register new patients and manage their records.
*   **Token Generation:** Easily create and manage tokens for different services.
*   **Prescription Management:** Doctors can create digital prescriptions, and pharmacists can manage orders.
*   **Inventory Management:** Pharmacists can track and manage drug inventory.
*   **Patient Feedback:** A system for patients to provide feedback and for the hospital to review it.
*   **Display Management:** Configure public displays to show queue status.
